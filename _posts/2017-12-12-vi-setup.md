title: Productive plugins for VIM
category: posts
---

This post is intended to track all of the plugins which I'm currently making use of, in an
attempt to make my setup more reproducable.

## For Go support:

[vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)

From their tutorial:
```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/plugged/vim-go
```

Edit .vimrc to include:
```
call plug#begin()
Plug 'fatih/vim-go', { 'do': ':GoInstallBinaries' }
call plug#end()
```

## For handling YAML and JSON editing:

I've gotten slammed a few times by parsing errors of JSON/YAML files by applications which
would silently fail, leading me to wonder for too long the cause of failure. 

# .vimrc
```
set hlsearch

call plug#begin()
Plug 'fatih/vim-go', { 'do': ':GoInstallBinaries' }
Plug 'ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim'
call plug#end()

```

# .vim/

--plugins
--bundles...



```
$ tree -L 2
