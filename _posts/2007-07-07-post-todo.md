- Necessary deep dives:
 * Implementation details: vhost-user-net, vhost-net, virtio-net-pci
 * compare VPP vs berkley switch vs VFIO for virtual switch
 * using CNI plugins on multiple hosts:
    -what is IP masquerading, what are my DHCP server options
    -tracing services vs launching pods on a cluster (ie, look at the iptables)
 * Basic understanding of IP tables
 * Overall networkign architecture "stuff" -- edge, central office, etc.
- Any Go Gotchas/learnings along the way
- Saving my vimo setup for easy replication later?

- Type up notes when reading the [BPF paper](http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf)
